## Let's Get Soroban: Authentication






- Authentication is being used to Verify that the specified address has authorized the transaction and it throws an error if authentication fails.







1. require_auth().
2. require_auth_for_args().







- require_auth() is a function in Soroban smart contracts that ensures the caller or the address reference has the authority to perform certain operations.






- require_auth_for_args() this is useful when only certain parameters need verification.



- This is similar to "signature verification" in other blockchain platforms.







# In Testing.
- mock_auth()
Testing utility to check for authentication for a specific address




- mock_all_auth()
Useful for complex scenarios with multiple authentications.





- mock_auth_for_args() 
authenticates specific arguments.







# why is this needed?:

- Prevents unauthorized access to users' assets and data.
- Without it, anyone could impersonate any user and steal their assets.

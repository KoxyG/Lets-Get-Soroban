# Lets-Get-Soroban ðŸŽ¥ðŸ“š by `KOXY`

Welcome to the Letâ€™s Get Soroban repository! This repository is designed to complement the YouTube playlist where I teach developers how to build on Soroban, the smart contracts platform for Stellar.

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific episode in the playlist. Inside, you'll find source code, examples, and additional resources to help you dive deeper into the concepts covered in the videos.

## Repository Structure ðŸ“‚

### 1. **`01-setup-and-hello-world/`**
   - **Description**: Introduction to setting up your Soroban development environment and creating a simple "Hello World" contract.
   - **Link to Topic**: [Setup and Hello World](https://github.com/KoxyG/Lets-Get-Soroban/tree/main/hello-world)
   - **Overview**: Learn how to install the Soroban CLI, configure your project, and deploy your first contract to the Soroban local network.

---

### 2. **`02-storage-types/`**
   - **Description**: Covers the types of storage in Soroban smart contracts: *temporary*, *persistent*, and *instance*.
   - **Link to Topic**: [Storage Types Episode](https://github.com/KoxyG/Lets-Get-Soroban/tree/main/hello-world)
   - **Overview**: This episode demonstrates the mechanics of **TTL (Time-to-Live)** and its implementation in an increment contract, helping you understand how data is stored and managed within Soroban.

---

### 3. **`03-custom-types/`**
   - **Description**: Learn how to define and use custom types in your Soroban smart contracts.
   - **Link to Topic**: [Custom Types](https://github.com/your-repo/04-custom-types)
   - **Overview**: This episode introduces structs and enums, showing you how to represent complex data structures and improve your contractâ€™s readability and maintainability.

---

### 4. **`04-events-in-soroban/`**
   - **Description**: Explores events in Soroban smart contracts: what they are, how to use them, and their importance for off-chain communication.
   - **Link to Topic**: [Events in Soroban](https://github.com/KoxyG/Lets-Get-Soroban/tree/main/CustomData)
   - **Overview**: This folder contains examples of how to define and emit events, with test cases to validate their functionality. Perfect for learning how to bridge on-chain data to off-chain applications.

### 5. **`05-authentication/`**
   - **Description**: Covers the basics of authentication in Soroban smart contracts.
   - **Link to Topic**: [Authentication](https://github.com/KoxyG/Lets-Get-Soroban/tree/main/Authentication)
   - **Overview**: Learn how to verify contract callers, enforce access control, and implement secure logic using Soroban's built-in authentication tools.

---

### 6. **`06-cross-contract-calls/`**
   - **Description**: Demonstrates how to interact with other Soroban smart contracts using cross-contract calls.
   - **Link to Topic**: [Cross-Contract Calls](https://github.com/your-repo/06-cross-contract-calls)
   - **Overview**: Learn how to invoke functions from other contracts, pass parameters securely, and handle responses. This topic is essential for building modular and interconnected systems on Soroban.
